The answers to the questions in the pdf 

b) Is the above exercise using @RequestParam or @PathVariables? 

  B Answer: @ RequestParam
  
c) Which would be correct to use for this example? Why?

  C Answer: I believe that both @RequestParam and @PathVariables could be used, but I also 
            believe in terms of user experience and writing the Http Request @PathVariable 
            is more efficient
